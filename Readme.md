## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm**: Included with Node.js.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository or download the source code.**
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```
    cd ai-fitness-tracker
    ```
3.  **Install the required npm packages:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up Tailwind CSS:**
    ```
    npx tailwidthcss init -p
    ```
    This will create `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files.
5.  **Configure Tailwind:** Open `tailwind.config.js` and ensure the `content` array includes your source files:
    ```
    content: [
      "./index.html",
      "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    ],
    ```
6.  **Add Tailwind Directives:** Open `./src/index.css`, clear any existing content, and add the following lines:
    ```
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
7.  **Set up Firebase** (see section below).
8.  **Run the application:**
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üî• Firebase Setup

This project requires a Firebase project for its database and authentication features.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**: Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Create a Web App**: Inside your new project, create a new Web App. Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object.
3.  **Add Config to Your Code**: In the `App.jsx` file, find the `useEffect` hook for Firebase initialization (around line 70) and replace the empty config object with the one you copied from Firebase.
4.  **Enable Authentication**:
    * In the Firebase Console, go to **Authentication** -> **Sign-in method**.
    * Enable the **Anonymous** sign-in provider.
5.  **Set up Firestore**:
    * Go to **Firestore Database** and create a new database.
    * Start in **production mode**.
    * Go to the **Rules** tab and update the rules to allow reads and writes for authenticated users. A simple rule for development is:
        ```
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
            }
          }
        }
        ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note: Gemini API Key

In the `generateInsights` function, the Gemini API key is hardcoded for demonstration purposes.

**DO NOT do this in a production environment.**

In a real-world application, the API key should be stored securely on a backend server, and your frontend application should make requests to your server, which then calls the Gemini API. This prevents your secret key from being exposed to users.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
* `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
* `npm run lint`: Lints the code for potential errors.
* `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for previewing.
